      This is the street everyday i walk on. In this picture it sees quiet and good. But in morning it is very crowded as people go on work full of cars running.

      During winter it seems so beautiful and clean but unable walk sometimes as it is full of ice. Not able to see sideways even. it seems very difficult to walk even.
